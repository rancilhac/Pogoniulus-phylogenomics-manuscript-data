# Pogoniulus-phylogenomics-manuscript-data

This repository contains a series of scripts to reproduce analyses and figures for the manuscript "Introgression across narrow contact zones shapes the genomic landscape of phylogenetic variation in a tinkerbird clade". The data associated with these scripts can be accessed at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12799765.

Note: the scripts were written and run in R v. 4.1.1, and I cannot ensure that they will work under another R version.
